# Trucking_Calculator

Under the instruction of Dr. Mauricio Gomez at the University of Texas at San Antonio in his Programming I lecture, I created a program used to read the average miles driven by a truck driver for every day of the week. It will then start asking the value of miles driven for Monday and will continue asking the values until getting the value corresponding to Sunday. The program will then print the table shown above based on the values input by the user.
